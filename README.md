The idea comes from a [scavenger hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger_hunt), were tokens are collected and the goal is to collect as many as possible. 

We suggest exercises that build on community tutorials and lessons, after an exercise is finished it can be evaluated and one or more tokens can be collected.

**Note: This project is in an early development phase**
