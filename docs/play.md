# How to start collecting tokens?

After setting up your fork, now you are ready to start collecting tokens.

## Exercises as issues 

You will see that now the repository has some issues, and if you sort them by oldest, you should see something like this.

Each issue contains an exercise, and by finishing each exercise, you will collect one or more tokens.

Note that the issues have labels depending on the skill that will be practiced. 

## Score board

Your repository also has now an additional `score` branch. The `score.md` file in this branch will be the place where your collected tokens, in this case stars, are being stored.

The first token is earned after the setup, and would look something like this
