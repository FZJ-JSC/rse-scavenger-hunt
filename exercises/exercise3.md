# Exercise 3
This exercise should be helpful to practice markdown. 

Create a new branch on this repository, name it markdown and modify the file in the documentation folder. 

You can write about anything you would like, but it has to include the following: a title, a subtitle, text, bullet points and an image.

Another option, could be to modify the readme from the recipes repo.
